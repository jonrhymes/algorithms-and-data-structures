// GRAPHS - Nodes and Connections
// Used for:
// - Social Networks, Location Mapping, Routing Algorithsm

// Vertex = A Node
// Edge = Connection between Nodes
// Weighted/Unweighted = Values assigned to distances between Vertices
// Directed/Undirected = Directions assigned to distances between Vertices


// Adjancency Matrix - Takes up more space, Slower to iterate over all edges, BUT...
// Faster to look up specific edge

// Adjacency List - Takes up LESS space, FASTER to iterate over all edges, BUT...
// SLOWER to look up specific edge
